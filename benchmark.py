"""Simple benchmark runner that tests an LLM on the text-mode game.

It launches the game's `run_text` in a subprocess, reads the game's stdout until the
interactive prompt, calls the OpenAI API (configurable model) to get the next move,
parses the response and feeds it back to the game process.

Usage:
    python benchmark.py --model gpt-4o-openrouter --level levels/level1 --steps 200

Environment:
    Create a .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY and optionally OPENAI_API_BASE (for OpenRouter)

    You are playing a simple tile-based cooking game. 

    The map is a grid-world consisting of 4 different block types:
    - floor: marked by '.', you can move freely on floor blocks, each move costs you one 'game_time'
    - wall: marked by '#', you can't move through wall blocks
    - dispenser: marked by a digit 1-9, impassable, you can *interact* with it to acquire an ingredient if your inventory is empty
    - appliance: marked by a uppercase letter A-E, impassable, you can *interact* with it to either 1. place the contents of your inventory inside or 2. take the contents of the appliance if your inventory is empty
    Furthermore, if an appliance contains a specific combination of ingredients, it performs an 'operation', yielding a novel ingredient after some amount of 'game_time' passes.
    By writing 'info', you can display information about the given task - a textual recipe, a mapping which maps objects in the recipe to block ids on the board, inventory and appliance states.
    Your goal is to perform the actions described in the recipe in as little 'game_time' as possible.
    Each move on the board costs 1 'game_time'. If your move is blocked by an impassable object, the player just changes orientation without incrementing 'game_time'.
    Interacting and summoning info does not cost 'game_time'. If you need to pass 'game_time' without moving, (e.g. when waiting for an appliance to finish an operation), use the 'skip' command.

    The game prints the board and then prompts with '> ' when it wants your next action.
    You must respond with exactly one of the following commands (lowercase): up, down, left, right, interact, info, skip, quit.
    Do not output any other text or commentary â€” only the single command followed by a newline.
