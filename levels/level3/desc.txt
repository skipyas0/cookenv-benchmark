Chocolate Cake

First, mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and butter in a bowl to create the cake batter.
Pour the batter into the baking pan and bake it for 15 minutes until you get a baked cake.
Let the baked cake cool for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix cream and sugar in another bowl to make frosting.
Finally move to the cutting board and spread the frosting over the cooled cake to finish the layered chocolate cake.
