Tropical Coconut Curry

Start by preparing the aromatic curry base: combine coconut milk, diced mango, lime juice, and curry powder in a saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes. 
Then, in a pot, mix cooked rice with the curry base and chickpeas. Stir well for 3 minutes to finish the tropical coconut curry.
