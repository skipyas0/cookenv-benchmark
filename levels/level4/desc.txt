Christmas Dinner
You have a lot to coordinate, so get your heat sources going first. Place the bread in the oven for 10 minutes to dry it out into dry bread. At the same time, get some water boiling in the cooking pot—it will take 10 minutes to become boiled water. You will also need hot oil for frying later; you can heat oil in either the pan or the cooking pot for 5 minutes.
While those appliances are running, handle your prep on the cutting board. Chop the vegetables into cut vegetables, slice the chicken breast into cut chicken, and prepare the whole fish into a fish filet. You also need to separate an egg into a cup to get egg yolks, and whisk another egg in a bowl to make mixed egg.
Once the bread is dry, blitz it in the blender for 4 minutes to make bread crumbs. Now set up a breading station on a plate: combine flour, mixed egg, and your fresh bread crumbs to coat the meat, turning the cut chicken into raw schnitzel and the fish filet into breaded fish.
By now your water should be hot. Use the boiled water in the cooking pot to boil an egg for 10 minutes into hard-boiled eggs. You will also need to use the cooking pot and boiled water to boil the cut vegetables for 13 minutes until they become cooked vegetables.
Free up the blender and mix oil, vinegar, and the egg yolks for 5 minutes to create mayo. In a bowl, combine the cooked vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, and mayo, mixing for 3 minutes to finish the potato salad.
Finally, fry your proteins using the hot oil you prepared (in either the pan or the cooking pot). The raw schnitzel needs to fry for 5 minutes to become schnitzel, and the breaded fish needs 4 minutes to become fried fish. Assemble the schnitzel, fried fish, and potato salad on a plate to serve the christmas dinner.
